#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that focuses on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications using systematic principles, engineering methodologies, and best practices. It applies structured techniques to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions that meet user needs and business requirements.
Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity (1960s – 1980s)-This milestone laid the foundation for software development methodologies that emphasized modularity and structured design, making large-scale projects more manageable.
Mastering Process (1980s – 2000s)-By formalizing development processes, organizations improved project management, reduced software failures, and increased productivity.
Mastering Machine (2000s – Present)-This milestone has led to more efficient, scalable, and secure software systems that can leverage modern hardware and emerging technologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Analysis:stakeholders define what the software needs to accomplish. Business analysts gather functional and non-functional requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops. 
Planning: The team develops a project plan including timelines, resource allocation, cost estimates, and risk management strategies.
Design: Software architects create the blueprint for the system
Coding: Developers write the actual code based on the design documents.
Testing: Quality assurance professionals systematically verify that the software meets requirements. 
Deployment:This involves installation, configuration, data migration, and user training. 
Maintenance and Support: After deployment, the team monitors the system, fixes bugs, and implements enhancements. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 1.Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach where development follows a structured flow: Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, with little room for changes.
Best Use Cases:
Large-scale projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., government systems, banking software).
Projects with strict regulatory compliance (e.g., medical software, aerospace systems).
Stable projects where requirements are unlikely to change.
2.Agile Methodologies
Agile is an iterative, flexible approach where software is developed in small, incremental cycles called sprints (typically 1-4 weeks). Agile emphasizes continuous feedback, adaptability, and collaboration.
Best Use Cases:
Startups and fast-paced projects that require frequent updates.
Customer-driven products where feedback influences development (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS platforms).
Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., e-commerce platforms, AI applications).

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, and testing software. It typically includes a code editor, compiler/interpreter, debugger, and automation tools.
Importance of IDEs
Increases Productivity: Code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools help developers write and fix code faster.
Enhances Code Quality: Built-in linters and error detection prevent bugs before they reach production.
Facilitates Debugging: Step-by-step debugging tools help developers identify and resolve issues efficiently.
Supports Multiple Languages & Frameworks: Many IDEs support various programming languages, making development versatile.
Examples of Popular IDEs
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight, highly customizable, supports multiple extensions.
JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA – Preferred for Java development, rich in features.
Eclipse – Common for Java and enterprise applications.
PyCharm – Specialized for Python development.
Xcode – The go-to IDE for iOS and macOS app development.
2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
A VCS is a system that tracks changes to code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and manage code history effectively.
Importance of VCS
Facilitates Collaboration: Teams can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes.
Tracks Code Changes: Developers can see who made changes, when, and why.
Enables Rollbacks: If a bug is introduced, previous versions of the code can be restored.
Supports Branching & Merging: Developers can work on different features simultaneously and merge them when ready.
Examples of Popular VCS
Git – The most widely used VCS, distributed and flexible.
GitHub – A cloud-based Git repository hosting service for team collaboration.
GitLab – Provides built-in CI/CD pipelines for DevOps workflows.
Bitbucket – Offers Git repositories with Atlassian integrations (JIRA, Trello).
SVN (Apache Subversion) – A centralized version control system still used in legacy projects.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i)Software bugs can be difficult to identify and fix, especially when dealing with unpredictable behaviors or hard-to-reproduce errors.
Strategies to overcome: Use debug tools and use error tracking tools
ii)New programming languages, frameworks, and tools emerge frequently, making it difficult for engineers to stay updated.
Strategies to overcome: Attend tech conferences and meetups.Follow industry leaders and communities
iii)Software engineers often face tight deadlines, feature creep, and unrealistic expectations, leading to stress and burnout.
Strategies to overcome: Use Agile methodologies. Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests 
- are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
- it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests
 - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing
 -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests
- are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt
"Create a website for my business."
Improved Prompt
"Design a responsive e-commerce website for my handmade jewelry business that includes product catalog with filtering, secure checkout process, customer reviews, and an about page showcasing our crafting process. The brand aesthetic should be minimalist with a color palette of teal and gold. The target audience is women aged 25-45 who value artisanal products."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
The improved prompt is more effective for several reasons:

Specificity: The improved prompt defines the exact type of website (e-commerce), the specific business (handmade jewelry), and the required features (catalog, checkout, reviews, about page).
Clear constraints: It establishes design parameters (minimalist, teal and gold color scheme) that help guide the solution.
Context: It provides important background on the target audience and brand values, which informs design and functionality decisions.
Scope definition: The prompt outlines the specific pages and features needed, preventing scope creep or missing essential elements.
Purpose: It clarifies the business goals (selling handmade jewelry to a specific demographic) which helps prioritize features and design choices.
